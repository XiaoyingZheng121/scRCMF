This is a MATLAB implementation of scRCMF, a computational method for single cell data analysis.

=======
Requires MATLAB R2015b or later.
=======

This directory includes:

   1) example.m -------- an example run of SOptSC on a specific dataset (see here for QUICKSTART).
   
   2) scRCMF_cluster.m  --------the M file contains all components of the algorithm for clusters. 
    Please refer to this file for further information.
   
   3) scRCMF_TC.m --------the M file contains all components of the algorithm for find transition states
   
   4) scRCMF_TE.m     -------- the M file contains all components of the algorithm for compute the entropy
   of transition states
   5) scRCMF_TP.m     -------- the M file contains all components of the algorithm for compute the transition
   probability of transition states
	                      
   6) gene_pattern    --------  selected genes specified by users.

   7) Example data can be found in Data
